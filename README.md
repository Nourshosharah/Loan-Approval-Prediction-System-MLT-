Loan Approval Prediction System
This project is part of the Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) course for the Master in Computer Science program at the Syrian Virtual University (SVU) Supervised by Dr.Issam Salman.
It aims to provide a web-based intelligent assistant to help banks predict the approval of loan requests using machine learning models.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is: loan_prediction.csv
It contains historical loan applications along with information about the applicant and whether their loan was approved or not.

🧠 Features
🔍 1. Smart Loan Approval System
A trained machine learning model predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on user input.
Users can add a new loan request and get the model's prediction.



📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of approvals vs. rejections.
Loan amounts, income, credit history visualizations.
