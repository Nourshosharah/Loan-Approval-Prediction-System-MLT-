# Loan Approval Prediction System 
This project is part of the Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) course for the Master in Computer Science program at the Syrian Virtual University (SVU) Supervised by **Dr.Issam Salman**. 

It aims to provide a web-based intelligent assistant to help banks predict the approval of loan requests using machine learning models.

 ## Dataset  📁
The dataset used is: loan_prediction.csv It contains historical loan applications along with information about the applicant and whether their loan was approved or not.

##  Features 🔍 
1.  Smart Loan Approval System A trained machine learning model predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on user input. Users can add a new loan request and get the model's prediction.

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of approvals vs. rejections. Loan amounts, income, credit history visualizations.

📈 3. Model Evaluation Page Shows model performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Includes confusion matrix and classification report.

## Technologies Used Python 🚀 

1. Scikit-learn

2. Pandas / NumPy

3. Django /Streamlit (for backend)

4. Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib for EDA

5. HTML/CSS/JS for front-end
